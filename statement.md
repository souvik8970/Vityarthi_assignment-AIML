# Problem Statement
Traditional library systems are limited to only storing data. The problem addressed here is the lack of *intelligence* in digital management tools. A modern system should not just track inventory, but also use data (user input) to **predict** and provide insights.

# Scope
This project is an **Intelligent Library System** built in Python. Its core focus is demonstrating basic **Classification Logic** and persistent file handling. It includes standard library functions and a specific AI module that analyzes user input.

# Target Users
* **AI/ML Learners:** For practical demonstration of Rule-Based Classification models.
* **Librarians:** For simple digital record-keeping.

# High-Level Features
1.  **AI User Classification:** A rule-based module that analyzes reading topics to predict and classify the user's primary interest (e.g., Tech Enthusiast).
2.  **Data Persistence:** Uses CSV file handling to save and retrieve book records permanently.
3.  **Smart Search:** Allows users to find books using partial keywords.
4.  **Modular Structure:** Code is split into logic, data, and UI files for easy maintenance and testing.
